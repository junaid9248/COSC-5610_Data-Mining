3.	Applications Across Smart City Domains 
3.1	Transportation and Mobility: 
3.1.1	Traffic management and prediction: Smart cities can leverage historical traffic patterns and real-time sensor data from IoT devices to deploy and train predictive models that can anticipate congestion hotspots and thus optimize signal timings, reduce ITS response times and reformat time schedules for public transport vehicles [2]. Utilizing data on traffic congestion from pilot cities like Thessaloniki and classification techniques, researchers have developed traffic management frameworks utilizing real-time data from GPS-enabled vehicles and surveillance cameras that run a decision tree classification model for predicting traffic congestion that helps in dynamically rerouting traffic and reducing average travel times by 15–25%. Additionally, by using data from GIS systems, spatial-temporal correlation analysis employing K-nearest-neighbors (KNN) algorithms allows systems to forecast traffic flow by considering the characteristics of nearby road segments, increasing accuracy by 40–50% [3]. 
3.1.2	Public transport optimization: Public transit systems benefit from data mining through demand forecasting and route optimization. In Beijing, officials were able to reorganize transit timetables and reallocate resources during peak hours by mining smart card transaction data from subway systems to identify commuter home addresses and trip purposes [4][6]. Recent research by Oh Donghee et al. [5] applied various regression-based data mining models to predict bus demand in vulnerable urban and suburban areas. Additionally, the study employs the K-means clustering algorithm to extract regional characteristics and differentiate between urban and suburban bus stop allocation areas. These approaches allowed city planners to optimize resource allocation and improve service frequency to regions that needed it but were being overlooked.
3.1.3	Intelligent parking systems: Smart parking systems employ the use of classification models, neural networks, and data from edge computing systems. Evaluating real-time parking data from Birmingham, UK; Koumetio Tekouabou et al.[7] have come up with a smart parking availability framework by leveraging ensemble-based regression models, including Bagging Regression, Random Forest Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression, and Adaptive Boosting Regression which has outperformed previous models by 6.6% and reduced mean absolute error to a mere 0.06%. In particular, the ensemble-based regression model proved especially effective in handling the high volume and variability of parking data, leading to more robust and reliable predictions
3.2	Public Safety and Security
3.2.1	Crime prediction and prevention: Modern policing policies rely on correlating geo-spatial and temporal data from criminal behavior that can be used to classify and predict crimes through deep-learning neural networks, adaptive ensemble clustering models, naïve bayes classifiers, partitioning-based clustering models, time-series regression models, vertices-connections based social network classifiers and many other models [8]. Al-Ghushami et al. [9] used the crime statistics of San Francisco to predict types of crimes likely to happen in different parts of the city testing out the accuracy of crime pattern theory through several classification models namely, naive bayes, weighted k-nearest neighbors (using k=100 and weightage as per the Euclidean distances), multi-layer perceptron classifier, gaussian naive bayes, decision tree, random forest, adaboost, gradient boosting, linear discriminant analysis and quadratic discriminant analysis notably achieving up to 74% accuracy with the gradient boosting, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and AdaBoost models. 
3.2.2	Surveillance and monitoring applications: Video surveillance systems (VSS) have evolved with the integration of real-time classifying algorithms, edge computing and cloud storage to capture abnormal or negative activities of both people and vehicles. Data mining techniques for object detection and classification include traditional (ie: Support vector machines, K-Nearest neighbor etc.) and increasingly deep learning models such as convolutional and recurrent neural networks. For real-time object tracking as well deep learning based tracking algorithms such as you-only-look-once (YOLO) have become a preferred choice. Human Action Recognition (HAR) based on Long-short term memory (LSTM) CNNs and RNNs has become the standard for classifying negative human behaviors from video sequences [10]. One such VSS implementation was developed by Pawar et al. [11] to automatically detect, classify, and track suspicious individuals or activities, trigger real-time alerts, and support rapid intervention by authorities. Reported accuracies for action recognition and anomaly detection frequently exceed 90%, demonstrating the practical value of these techniques for enhancing public safety in smart cities.
3.3	Energy and Sustainability
3.3.1	Smart grid health and energy consumption optimization: Smart grids have replaced power grids with the addition of sensors, edge computing systems and other data collection systems that add to the big data stream that can now be collected on a real-time basis from the grid operation. So, there is a need for algorithms that can analyze their performance, periodically perform vulnerability assessment and optimize their operation mechanisms. For performance optimization, an example of implementation is Feature Selection-Based Ranking (FSBR) approach proposed by El-Balka et al. [12] in which filtering is performed through different ranking techniques (i.e., relative weight ranking, effectiveness ranking, and information gain ranking) the results of which are sent to a fuzzy inference engine that generates final feature ranking for selection. In the next phase, data is selected based on previous ranking and three different classifiers (i.e., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network) to select the best set of the features based on the performance of the classifiers. This approach not only helps in data management by reducing the complexity, dimensions and computation time required by these features being stored in clous storage but also enables user-load forecasting to take fast action in times of short-term load forecasting with a high accuracy. Using the FSBR approach, when tested on standard EUNITE dataset, selecting only the top 3 features was enough to give an accuracy score of 0.91, and 0.9 F1- score measure for the user demand thus greatly reducing dimensionality while maintaining high accuracy. This allows distributors to prepare for higher energy consumption periods and distribute power units efficiently. Another key application of data mining for smart grids is Dynamic Vulnerability Assessment (DVA). DVA is a fundamental task for a self-healing grid application that deploys correction control mechanisms to mitigate the potential for blackout or service disruption. In a proposed model, using time-series dimension reduction procedures such as Multichannel Singular Spectrum Analysis (MSSA) of grid signals and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of features it is first possible to decompose signals into only their crucial features. With the key features in hand, machine learning classifying models such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can be used to label a grid as ‘vulnerable’ and ‘not at risk’ with 97% accuracy for sample datasets [13][14].
3.3.2	Environmental monitoring: One of the more defining goals that smart cities aim to achieve is improving sustainability. Smart cities utilize sensor networks, visual monitoring systems and data mining algorithms together to develop strategies and laws that promote a healthier, greener, and nature-friendly life for its citizens. This starts with pollution monitoring. The large quantity of data collected from smart Environment Monitoring (SEM) systems is processed using a number of data mining classifiers. Data captured from video surveillance systems can be used as the dataset for water pollution level prediction and classification into potable/non-potable water [10]. For Water Pollution Monitoring (SWPM Systems), images of water bodies using can be used to predict pollution levels and thus classify them as drinkable/non-drinkable and predicting their quality [15]. Linear regression and Stochastic Gradient Descent regression analysis can be used to predict pollution levels of water bodies while SVMs can classify water bodies as polluted or clean. Specific water quality parameters such as alkalinity, chlorophyll-A concentration and sulphate can also be predicted using water body images passed through RNNs. In the same way using data from Air Quality Monitoring (SAQM Systems), support vector machines (air quality prediction using heterogenous sensor data on CO2, NO2 and other gaseous levels) and deep learning models (detection and detailed analysis of Ozone (O3) concentration using ozone data) are increasingly being employed to discover pollution hotspots. Interestingly, the analysis of noise pollution through data mining can take several routes including social media data mining [15]. A study focused on the UAE explored using Twitter data to identify and monitor noise annoyance [16]. Researchers employed a lexicon-based search algorithm (text mining) to sift through millions of tweets, identifying messages related to noise complaints. By extracting GPS coordinates associated with these tweets, they could map potential noise pollution hotspots and analyze the types of noise sources mentioned (e.g., music, transport) and the time/location of the complaints. Another study investigated noise pollution in New York City by mining multimodal geo-social big data from platforms like Foursquare, Twitter, Flickr, and Gowalla [17]. By parsing the extracted text features as sentiment scores and pairing them with geo-temporal features the researchers were able to infer and visualize the volume and composition of noise pollution across different city regions, effectively reasoning about the sources of noise. Waste management is also a key part of sustainable development and data mining can help to optimize disposal routes, predict landfill-levels and improve vehicle life. One such example can be found in Lahore, Pakistan where implementation of a smarter integrated disposal system demonstrated substantial improvements using such systems, including a 32% increase in route efficiency, a 29% reduction in fuel consumption and emissions, and significant savings in vehicle maintenance [18].
3.4	Citizen-centric applications
3.4.1	Public healthcare analysis: Beyond infrastructure and environmental benefits smart cities focus intensively on individual citizen centric quality of life improvements that come with integration of technologies with cities. One of these is the public health sector. Environmental health risk assessment can be conducted using pollution metrics (air, water and noise) and classification techniques such as SVMs, CNNs and more [15][16][17]. Correlating these findings with public health data, researchers can identify links between increasing pollution and emerging diseases and develop models to accurately predict these links with a high range of accuracy and recall. One such model is proposed by Rodrigues et al. [19] titled ‘VitalSense’ provides a hierarchical multi-tier remote health monitoring architecture in smart cities by combining edge, fog, and cloud computing that runs on classified and sorted data from data mining algorithms. Data mining also enables a more holistic view of community health. ICTs underpinning smart cities facilitate the collection of granular, real-time data from mobile devices, ambient sensors, and citizen reports (crowdsourcing/citizen sensing) can be used to classify, predict and possibly prevent outbreaks and promote overall health of entire public sphere.
3.4.2	Smart Education applications: Like many other sectors, education is also one which smart cities focus on as smart citizens are the backbone of a smart city’s progress. With the vast amount of data thus available on educational metrics both past and present, it has now become possible to provide personalized and overall directions to students with technology at the heart of education. One of the most important applications of data mining techniques in the education sector is that it has now become easier to detect and categorize students on the basis of their performance metrics. It is also now possible to predict whether a student is bound to struggle or be left behind based on other metrics. This means that it is also possible to promote and aid these students by detecting signs early on. A great example is presented by Yang [20] in their resource collection algorithm based on data mining techniques. This algorithm can analyze student needs, academic records, and curriculum requirements (e.g., from academic affairs systems) to automatically collect and recommend relevant educational resources, such as materials for entrepreneurship and employment education.
